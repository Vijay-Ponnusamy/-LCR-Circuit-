⚡ Interactive LCR Circuit Exploration using Falstad 🔁
🧭 Project Overview
This initiative focuses on modeling an LCR (Inductor-Capacitor-Resistor) circuit using the Falstad Circuit Simulator, offering a hands-on approach to studying AC behavior in reactive circuits. The simulation highlights dynamic properties like resonance, phase relationships, and impedance in a visually engaging environment.

🔩 Circuit Elements Utilized
•	Inductor (L): Simulates energy storage via magnetic fields.
•	Capacitor (C): Stores electrical energy through electrostatic fields.
•	Resistor (R): Introduces resistance, dissipating power as heat.
•	AC Source: Provides alternating voltage to stimulate oscillations.
•	Wires & Ground: Complete the electrical loop and reference potential.

🔬 Key Learning Concepts
•	Resonance Point: Frequency where capacitive and inductive reactances cancel each other, leading to peak current.
•	Impedance (Z): Frequency-dependent resistance faced by AC.
•	Voltage-Current Phase Angle: Describes whether current leads or lags the voltage.
•	Oscillatory Energy Exchange: Energy alternates between L and C without net loss, except via R.

🎓 Learning Outcomes
By engaging with the simulation, you’ll gain insight into:
✅ The frequency response of LCR circuits under varying conditions
✅ How to locate and understand resonance and its consequences
✅ The role of damping, reactance, and Q-factor in circuit efficiency
✅ Phase alignment between current and voltage and its importance in AC systems

🛠️ Simulation Tips
•	Try sweeping the frequency range to identify when current peaks (resonance).
•	Observe how voltages across each component shift as frequency varies.
•	Use oscilloscope tools to track waveform phase delays or advances
